7.1 Coincident Multimiking
7.1.1 Phase-Aligning Multiple Mics
First of all, I’d like to explore ‘coincident’ multimiking techniques, where microphones are set up with their diaphragms as close to each other as possible, the
idea being that the sound from the instrument arrives at all the diaphragms
simultaneously, and all the recorded signals therefore remain in phase with
each other. However, trying to phase-align mics by eye can be tricky, because the
exact location of a given mic’s diaphragm is frequently obscured by a grille basket (or some such protective apparatus), so most engineers rely on the following time-honoured trick for phase-aligning pairs of microphones by ear.
1. Stick a stationary sound source in front of the mics.
2. Fade up each microphone signal to roughly the same level in your controlroom monitor mix.
3. Invert the polarity of one of the two signals.
4. Leaving one mic stationary, adjust the miking distance of the other to
achieve the best phase-alignment, which will be where the mic signals cancel each other out most strongly. (They’ll never completely cancel each other
out, though, because their signals won’t be exactly identical.)
5. Remove the polarity inversion applied in step 3.
This should allow you to mix the two mics freely without
significant comb-filtering artefacts. To phase-align any
further mics, just repeat the process. If you’re quick
on your feet, you can actually do this from scratch
on the session, but I prefer to save time by phasealigning my chosen line-up of mics in advance—a
portable radio provides an excellent sound source
for this, and keeps you abreast of the Test Match
results into the bargain! Once you’ve aligned the mics
relative to each other, label each one with masking tape

‘Once you’ve

(as shown in Figure 7.1) so you can easily recover the alignment should it be
disturbed accidentally during the session. With end-fire mics, some people just
gaffer-tape the mics together, which has the advantage that you require one less
mic stand, but I’m not a huge fan of this because it makes it a hassle to swap out
one of those mics later. Phase-aligning multimic rigs in advance can also reveal if
any mics or cables are actually wired with inverted polarity, something that’s also
worth marking in some way to avoid confusion in the heat of a session.
The one disadvantage of using phase-aligned mic arrays is that even the slightest accidental movement of the microphones can significantly damage the
recorded sound, so do guard against this. Once your multimiked sound has
been given the green light, lock down those mic stands so that they don’t
sag, and maybe take a picture of the setup on your phone just in case disaster
strikes. Having a word with the performer about this issue is a good idea in this
context, because they might not think it’s a particularly big deal to move the
mic slightly while getting out of their chair as long as they put it back roughly
in the right place. Make it clear that you need to know if any mic is inadvertently nudged, so that you can recheck the phase-alignment.
Figure 7.1
A good way to phase-align coincident multimics prior to your recording session is using a portable
radio—remember that the best phase alignment often won’t be the best visual alignment! Once you’ve
got the mics in phase with each other, mark their relative positions with masking tape, just in case they
get knocked out of line for any reason.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 225
7.1.2 Combining Polar Patterns
So what’s the point of using coincident mics? Well, firstly it allows you to
customise the directionality of the multimic array as a whole. The simplest
scenario is where you combine a directional mic with an omni, both mics
pointing in the same direction. Balancing the two mic signals against each
other then effectively provides any pattern between them—in fact, every one
of the cardioid-family patterns if the directional microphone happens to be a
figure-eight. (The ‘Strauss Paket’ scheme pioneered by renowned classical engineer Volker Strauss applies the same concept, using gaffered-together omni and
cardioid small-diaphragm condensers to create the less commonplace subcardioid directionality.) Advantages of this approach over a single-mic setup are
that you can control the pickup response freely from the control room, and
that you get access to a full range of intermediate cardioid-style polar patterns
between the standardised ones.
Angling coincident microphones relative to each other opens up many other
useful options, though. Imagine you have a coincident pair of cardioid mics,
both facing an instrument head-on and mixed at equal levels to a single
recorder track. The combined pickup of this two-mic array will clearly still be
cardioid. However, if you splay the two mics relative to each other, the width of
their combined polar pattern will increase.
If all mics had theoretically perfect polar patterns, this ‘crossed pair’ technique
wouldn’t be big news, because you could just get a wider pattern from a single
subcardioid or omni with less hassle. But crossed pairs really shine with realworld mics because they enable you to counteract the high-frequency spotlighting effect of close-miking, given that most mic designs are markedly brighter
on-axis. By turning the mics in slightly different directions, the two spotlights
diverge, giving good high-frequency coverage across a larger area of the instrument. With cheaper large-diaphragm condensers (the worst off-axis culprits),
the effect is particularly striking, but the benefits also extend to well-behaved
small-diaphragm mics, albeit in subtler form. In this scenario, it’s inadvisable
for the angle between the firing directions of the two mics to go much beyond
90° with large-diaphragm models, otherwise you begin to lose too much highfrequency definition directly in front of the multimic rig, but even with smaller
diaphragms there’s usually little to be gained, because you’ll just get more room
reverb without further weakening the spotlighting effect substantially.
The crossed pair’s combined polar pattern won’t be symmetrical in three
dimensions either. The vertical pickup of a horizontally splayed pair will be
narrower, for instance, so it will pick up slightly less room reverb than a single
mic with the same horizontal pickup width. As with rectangular-diaphragm
condensers (see Section 6.3.3), you should consequently take care how the
pair’s orientation relates to that of the sound source. For example, if you’re
multimiking an acoustic guitar from somewhere in front, you might splay the
microphones horizontally to match the width of the instrument, whereas with
a harp you might choose a vertical orientation to take in its height.

Mounting Hardware for Multimiking
Mounting a coincident mic array on a single stand makes it much more convenient to move around without
upsetting the phase-alignment. The most common gizmo for doing this is called a ‘stereo bar’, and is fitted to
the end of a normal mic-stand’s boom arm crossways so that two microphones can be attached to it at different
(and preferably adjustable) positions along its length. You can get good-quality eight-inch stereo bars for under
$15 (£10) apiece that will accommodate the majority of end-fire crossed-pair configurations, but such a short
bar rarely provides enough
leeway to set up crossed pairs
with bulkier mics such as
large-diaphragm condensers
and ribbons. If getting hold of
a longer specimen for these
situations is a bit pricey for
you, check out K&M’s 238
Microphone Holder, because
this little $20 (£15) metal
bracket will let you clamp an
additional mic to almost any
part of a normal mic stand.
In fact, because it’ll fix to
practically any solid piece of
furniture, it’s generally a good
choice for low-budget studios
where there aren’t enough
proper mic stands to go round,
and it’s tremendously handy for
location recording too—I have
a half a dozen in my kit bag,
and use them to death! Budgetfriendly multimic mounting
hardware does have one
downside, however: it’s often
a bit fiddlier to set up than a
collection of individual stands,
so I highly recommend doing
battle with that before the talent
turns up.
Figure 7.2
Here you can see some different mic-mounting approaches for crossed pairs (clockwise
from top left): screw-on mic-mounting brackets; separate mic stands; and a short stereo
bar.
Because crossing a pair of mics alters their combined polar pattern, you’ll have
to account for this when listening for promising mic positions (as discussed
in Section 6.1.1) and managing the acoustics in your recording space. In this
context, my own impression is that a crossed pair of cardioids or figure-eights
roughly approximates the dry/wet balance of a subcardioid, while crossed
supercardioids or hypercardioids more closely resemble a single cardioid in
this respect. Crossed pairs aren’t just for directional mics, though, because
crossed large-diaphragm omnis will also benefit from much wider highfrequency pickup at close range than a single mic.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 227
7.1.3 Balancing Instrument Facets
A crossed pair of directional mics can also balance sounds
emanating from different parts of the instrument. So,
for example, a crossed pair over the strings of a piano
just behind the music stand might have one capsule
pointing towards the high strings and one towards
the low strings, allowing you to rebalance those
against each other easily from the control-room faders. The big benefit here is that it becomes quicker
to get a respectable sound directly out of the mics
without processing, which is a godsend for fast-moving
sessions where you may not have the opportunity to
move your mics before takes start going down. Moreover,
if you record the two microphones to separate recorder tracks, it
becomes possible to change the piano’s low/high balance at mixdown too.
Another extremely widespread application of the crossed pair (and a favourite
of Nashville engineers such as Chuck Ainlay1 and Bob Bullock2) involves putting the mics in front of an acoustic guitar, roughly in line with the twelfth
fret: one diaphragm points towards the fretboard to catch the direct sound of
the strings, and one is angled towards the instrument’s body for its richer resonances. Andy Johns mentions a similar idea for electric guitars, whereby two
SM57s are used on the same guitar speaker at a 45° angle to each other.3 ‘Put
them together, and it always works … As long as you position them so that
they’re equidistant from the speaker, they’re in phase and one of them will give
you all the high end you want and the other one will give you the bottom.’
With larger speaker cabinets, this technique allows you to blend the qualities
of the different driver cones. ‘They’re supposed to sound the same,’ comments
Roy Thomas Baker, ‘but if you’re using a 4×12 cabinet, each of those four
speakers may sound different.’4
The crossed pair can also provide control over a recording’s dry/wet balance.
For example, Ken Nelson mentions crossing a cardioid and a figure-eight mic
for this when recording acoustic guitar: the cardioid faces the instrument to
pick up mostly direct sound, while the figure-eight has its null plane aimed at
the instrument so that it picks up mostly room sound.5
7.1.4 Mixing Microphone Flavours
Coincident multimiking is tremendously popular amongst professionals who
like to mix and match the sonic flavours of different mics on a single instrument, with electric guitar/bass speaker cabinets, snare, and kick frequently
receiving this treatment in studios. ‘There’s an amazing difference in the sound
and coloration you get from adjusting the balance of each of the mics,’ remarks
John Leckie, ‘and you can get radically different textures depending on your
mix of [them].’6 Chris Lord-Alge is another fan: ‘Rather than jamming one mic
in front of an amp and grabbing the EQ, a couple of mics will give you better
‘Crossed
pairs aren’t just for
directional mics, because

much wider high-frequency

tone without the EQ and all the phase problems you get when cranking up the
EQ.’7 Again, a big advantage of this tactic is speed, because the sound-blending
process is so intuitive: if you put up a ribbon mic and an SM57, you immediately have an idea which fader will give you warmth and which presence,
and because the two mics are phase-aligned those two sound characters will
combine in a fairly natural way without comb-filtering artefacts. In addition,
I’ve found that I get a much better recorded sound using low-budget mics if I
combine them like this, rather than using them singly, whereas the quality difference between single-mic and multimic techniques seems less dramatic with
more expensive hardware.
Making the most of this approach involves selecting contrasting mics, because
that gives you a wider sonic range when you balance them against each other.
Mic-pairing maxims from various high-profile engineers bear this out: ‘condenser/ribbon’ (Tim Latham),8 ‘cheap’/’pricey’ (Stephen Street),9 ‘bright’/’dark’
(Steve Albini),10 and ‘good’/’bad’ (Jim Scott: ‘Between the two you can find the
ideal sound, and you can get brightness and fullness’11). My other tip is to try
to get hold of variable high-pass filtering for all the mic channels, because this
allows you to moderate the amount of proximity-effect bass boost contributed
by each mic, multiplying the number of usable sounds from your mic array
without adding much extra operational complexity. In addition, Frank Filipetti
makes the important point that adding an extra mic to the mix will also make
the combined signal louder, biasing your judgement. ‘[I] make sure that when
I take the mic away, my level is still the same,’ he says. ‘That gives me a much
truer taste of whether that mix is adding something.’12
Where multimiking is very rarely used is on vocals. This might initially seem
surprising, given the amount of time and attention lavished on refining vocal
sonics by other means, but there are two good reasons for it. Firstly, because
upper-spectrum ‘air’ frequencies above 10kHz are so important for vocal clarity, the phase-alignment of the microphones would have to be extremely accurate to avoid dulling them; and, secondly, any movement of the singer off-axis
would subtly affect the phase alignment and introduce more-or-less random
variations in the high-frequency timbre. Occasionally, though, you might still
consider putting up two mics if you’re recording someone with the projection
of an air-raid siren, in order to insure against your first-choice microphone overloading. In that case, a high-quality dynamic, a small-diaphragm condenser, or
even a boundary mic (as John Hudson used for Tina Turner) might serve as a
useful safety net.13
7.2 Non-Coincident Multimiking
7.2.1 Combining Close Mics
Although crossed-pair coincident miking can expand your polar pickup when
close-miking and provide control over the levels of different instrument facets,
it still only picks up the instrument from one location. With wooden-bodied

Using Speakers or Headphones as Mics
The transduction principle that most dynamic microphones use to convert air-pressure waves into electrical
signals is the same one that (in reverse) allows loudspeakers and headphones to convert electrical signals into
air-pressure waves. Because of this, it’s perfectly possible to wire up passive speaker/headphone drivers to
operate like dynamic mics. As you might imagine, they’ll give you a very coloured sound, not least because the
inertia of the super-large diaphragm provides very little transient detail and typically recesses the high-frequency
response, and you’re unlikely to get great noise or distortion performance either. However, any of these
attributes can become positives within the context of creative multimiking, by providing starkly contrasting tones
to complement other more hi-fi mics.
Although a small handful of commercial products have operated on this principle (notably Beyerdynamic’s M380,
constructed around one of their headphone drivers), the most well-known application of this idea is the hoary
old pro-studio trick of wiring up a spare Yamaha NS10 woofer to a mic input and hanging it in front of a kick
drum (or indeed any other instrument)—Jim Abbiss,14 Joe Barresi,15 Jerry Boys,16 Mike Fraser,17 and Andrew
Maury18 have all mentioned this in interview, for instance. The speaker cone’s heavy enough to prevent much in
the way of pickup above 500Hz, and it responds inordinately well to the sub-80Hz frequency range, because it’s
free from the speaker cabinet that would normally damp its inherent low-frequency resonances. You don’t just
have to use it on drums either—Shawn Everett used an NS10 to record one of Brittany Howard’s lead vocals on
the multi-Grammy winning Alabama Shakes album Sound & Color.
19
I’d argue that the popularity of the NS10 driver in this role has little to do with its specific sound, and more likely
stems from its ubiquity in commercial studios for mixing purposes, such that maintenance departments always
had a few spares lying around. Indeed, Dan
Austin,20 Mike Poole,21 Eric ‘Mixerman’ Sarafin,22
and Michael Wagener23 have all mentioned
using other speakers instead, and each different
driver will clearly impart its own unique tone,
if only on account of its individual resonance
characteristics. The speaker-as-microphone idea
predates the NS10 too, because Geoff Emerick
was already using it for Paul McCartney’s bass
sound on Paperback Writer in 1966.24 Yamaha
eventually adapted the idea into a robustly
engineered product called the Subkick, which
has now been discontinued, but similar current
products will set you back around $400 (£300),
so there’s still a good case for soldering up
something yourself if you’re working on a budget.
(See this chapter’s web resources for further
information on the do-it-yourself approach.)
instruments in particular, it’s difficult to achieve a full picture of the source in
this way because the complex body resonances cause such unpredictable frequency dispersion. Close-miking from different angles can therefore pick up a
more credible spectral balance.
As a mainstay of popular music, the acoustic guitar probably receives this treatment most frequently. Here’s Bill VornDick describing his setup, for instance:
‘I have one [mic] where the neck joins the body, pointed … where the high
Figure 7.4
A speaker can operate as a dynamic mic if wired up appropriately,
although it will typically have very poor high-frequency response.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 231
transients are. Then I have another one that looks down from where his right
shoulder is … covering the area in the middle between the wrist and shoulder—that microphone emulates what the guitarist is hearing, and will be
deeper in timbre.’25 Notice again how he’s deliberately chosen contrasted
timbres, increasing the tonal range available to him when balancing the mics
in the control room. ‘You can bring out the high mic or the low mic without
having to do anything EQ-wise except high-pass filtering,’ he adds. Another
approach popular with Gary Paczosa26 and Eric Valentine27 is to use two mics
in front of the instrument, with ‘one looking down at the strings from the top,
and one looking up from below,’ to quote Valentine himself.
Spaced multimiking is usually the most convenient choice for upright piano too,
whenever the instrument’s front panels are removed. By comparison, crossed
coincident pairs can be awkward to position, given the player’s central seating
location. (At least without the aid of a surgical saw.) However, I find that spaced
multimic arrays somehow overlay a hint of ‘honky-tonk’ onto pretty much any
piano that’s not a lovingly tuned nine-foot grand, so I often recommend coincident approaches for small-studio practitioners multimiking less refined
instruments.
The use of multi-speaker cabinets for electric guitars frequently prompts engineers to set up independent close mics for different cones. ‘It seems a little different than just using one mic,’ says Steve Churchyard.33 ‘It’s not twice as good,
but it’s just mixing the character of two different speakers.’ ‘Two SM57s on two
speakers sound more in phase to me than two SM57s on one speaker,’ adds Joe
Barresi.34 And why not take advantage of the different flavours of different mic
designs while you’re at it? Don Smith35 mentioned setting up an SM57 and an
AKG C452 small-diaphragm condenser for his work with the Rolling Stones, for
instance, while Toby Wright36 and Sylvia Massy37 have both used a combination
of SM57 and MD421.
Kick drums are regularly captured with spaced techniques. One mic is often
aimed directly at the beater contact point to achieve better attack definition,
With grand piano, we’ve already seen that balancing the lower and higher strings
is frequently the goal, and Al Schmitt has taken this approach by using largediaphragm omnis behind the music stand, angling the mics to control their
high-frequency directionality: ‘The close mics are usually a couple of feet off the
high end and a couple of feet off the low end, kind of at a 45° angle to each
other.’28 Another common alternative used by Brian Tankersley involves positioning one mic to cover the low- and mid-register strings at the point where
they cross over each other, and one mic to catch the higher strings closer to the
hammers.29 Tony Visconti,30 on the other hand, prefers to place both his multimics pointing towards the soundholes for more wood resonance and less
hammer attack, while Ed Cherney31
 and Jay Newland32 have both placed an
additional mic towards the foot of the piano to warm up the otherwise pristine
sound of a crossed pair of high-quality, small-diaphragm condensers hovering
behind the music stand.
232 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
with some engineers (e.g. Steve Marcantonio38 and Tony Visconti39) suggesting
a position inside the drum and others (e.g. Robbie Adams40 and Steve Albini41)
choosing a position on the batter-head side, particularly where the drum’s
resonant head is intact. This beater ‘click’ signal might then be balanced with
a fuller-sounding mic within the drum or fairly close to the resonant head.
Similar approaches are often taken with upright bass too, frequently involving
a mic near the instrument’s bridge to capture the low power and another higher
up to provide mid-range tone—a setup referred to by both Steve Chandler42
and Bill VornDick.43
Multimiking’s especially powerful when using contact mics, because you’ll get a
much more general-purpose sound from a pair of them than you’d ever expect
from hearing the typically quirky tone of a single one. Sticking one at either end
of the bridge on the front panel of an acoustic guitar has worked well for me in
the past, and orchestral string instruments seem to come across well with mics
fixed to the front and back of the body.
The main price you pay for the expanded tonal options of non-coincident multimiking is that the mic signals don’t mix together as intuitively as you’d expect
with coincident arrays, because they’re not phase-aligned. In other words, you
don’t just get a simple addition of each mic’s tonal attributes when you blend
them—you also get comb-filtering artefacts that will vary in strength depending

is particularly useful for

are removed, because

Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 233
on how similar-sounding the signals are, and what relative levels you mix them
at. You can reduce this comb-filtering somewhat by moving the mics close
enough to spotlight different areas of the instrument (thereby making the signals less similar), but this carries with it the danger of a rather unnatural sound.
Myself, I think it’s easiest to get good results if you first concentrate on carefully
positioning a single microphone to catch a fairly solid representation of the
whole instrument, because you can then use any additional mic at a comparatively low level for subtle enhancement without drastic comb-filtering penalties.
Either way, though, you’ll never eliminate phase-cancellation between the mics
completely, so you have to learn to work with it. For a start, be careful using
spaced microphone arrays with instrumentalists who move around a lot, otherwise the comb-filtering response will maraud around the frequency spectrum,
giving an inconsistency of tone that’s extremely difficult to handle at mixdown.
You also need to realise that although moving a mic an inch or two may not
have a huge effect on the sound of that mic in solo, it can significantly alter the
nature of the comb-filtering effect when multimic signals are mixed. This may
act in your favour if you happen to find a pair of microphone positions that
you like the sound of, but which comb-filter unpleasantly when combined,
because very small mic-position changes can often tweak the phase-cancellation into a more appealing form without upsetting the essential qualities of
each separate signal. Any filtering or equalising you do to individual mic channels will also become less predictable, because those processes don’t just affect
a signal’s frequency response—they also affect its ‘phase response’ (i.e. the
phase relationships between its individual sine-wave components), and hence
its contribution to any comb-filtering effect.
Phased Arrays
We’ve already seen how multimiking can be used to adjust the effective polar pickup of a coincident array, but
you can also increase the directionality of a non-coincident rig by setting up several microphones in a line, all
pointing at your sound source from the same distance—a configuration called a ‘phased array’. Anything arriving
at the array head-on will arrive at all the mics in phase, whereas anything arriving off-axis won’t be picked up as
effectively, because it’ll arrive at the mics at different times, resulting in phase-cancellation effects. The more
mics you add to the array, the more on-axis sources will be favoured. What complicates matters from a practical
perspective, however, is that the action of a phased array is frequency-dependent. The basic dilemma is this:
on the one hand, widening the array allows the system’s directionality to extend further down the frequency
spectrum, so larger mic spacings are beneficial from that perspective; but, on the other hand, comb-filtering of
off-axis sound becomes more severe for wider arrays, so narrower spacings will provide a clearer tone.
As such, I wouldn’t actively seek out phased arrays for directionality reasons while overdubbing, since
swapping/moving mics or increasing acoustic absorption in the recording space can achieve similar ends
without the comb-filtering damage. However, once you understand how phased arrays work, it provides
additional insight into the side-effects of other multimiking approaches. So, for example, the small but
unavoidable spacing between the diaphragms in a side-by-side coincident pair will narrow the array’s combined
polar pattern at high frequencies in the horizontal plane, and it also means you’ll probably get clearer off-axis
tonality above and below the array than you will from the sides.
234 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
Because comb-filtering plays such an important role here, a polarity-inversion
switch on every mic channel becomes well-nigh essential, because for any given
phase-relationship between two microphones, switching the polarity of one of
them will swap the positions of the comb-filtering response’s spectral peaks and
troughs, doubling the number of tonal flavours you can choose from. Where
more than two mics are used, the sonic variations multiply according to the
number of different polarity permutations available across all the component
mic channels. So every time you multimike an instrument with a non-coincident
array, creating a representative mixed sound in the control room becomes as
much about comparing the suitability of different polarity settings as it is about
juggling fader levels—something that can take a little getting used to.
Polarity inversion is particularly important if you decide to mike up any instrument at roughly equal distances on opposite sides. This is most common in the
case of snare drum, where John Astley,44 Bill Price,45 and Alan Winstanley46 are
just a few of the engineers who routinely mike it from both above and below,
allowing them to decide how much buzz they want from the snare wires. (This is
by no means an inviolable standard, though, with John Leckie,47 Alan Parsons,48
and Elliott Scheiner49 all expressing reservations about under-snare mics.) You
might also capture open-backed guitar cabinets using front and back mics for
a thicker low–midrange tone. ‘Gerry had an open-back amp that I miked from
behind with a Sennheiser 421,’ recalls Tony Visconti of David Bowie’s Heathen
sessions, ‘because I found I got more low end by positioning the mic there if
that’s what was called for. I sometimes also did that with David on his Supro
amps, which are open-back too.’50
Figure 7.6
Here you can see two dual-miking setups where polarity-inversion of one of the mics will usually be
advisable: miking an open-backed guitar amp from the front and rear simultaneously; and using top and
bottom snare-drum mics in tandem.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 235
Where more nuanced manipulation of phase relationships is required, then you
may wish to investigate variable phase adjusters, which provide a whole continuum of alternate tonal colours by shifting a channel’s phase response in less
straightforward ways. These aren’t exactly cheap in the analogue domain, unfortunately: the Radial Phazer’s good value, for instance, but still won’t leave you much
change from $400 (£350). However, if you’re working in software the good news
is that there are much cheaper alternatives available in plug-in form that are just
as powerful (see this chapter’s web resources for some suggestions).
Further tonal variations can be accessed by using a digital delay processor to
adjust the relative timing of individual signals in a multimic rig. Given that
phase cancellation occurs most obviously with timing offsets below about
20ms, you’ll need a delay with decent parameter resolution for this—delay-time
increments of 5ms will only give a handful of different tones compared with
steps of 0.1ms. (Many DAW systems have built-in high-resolution ‘sample delay’
plug-ins that work well for this, but again I’ve put some third-party plug-in
suggestions in this chapter’s web resources as well.) Bear in mind, however, that
if the effects of your delay processing are audible in the musician’s foldback
signal you may seriously tamper with their ability to perform, so I wouldn’t
suggest using anything more than a few milliseconds of artificial delay for tonecontrol purposes unless it’s easy to set up a separate cue mix without it.
7.2.2 Creative Use of Phase Relationships
In some cases, comb-filtering can become a positive virtue, most commonly
when miking amplified electric instruments. As I mentioned in Section 6.2.7,
close-miking techniques have long been used to sculpt an amplifier’s tone
into something that scarcely resembles what’s heard in the recording room.
Coincident multimiking expands on this concept a little, but it’s non-coincident
mic arrays that really up the stakes, giving you the power to utterly transform
the recorded timbre through creatively applied comb-filtering, without recourse
to traditional EQ processing. Jack Douglas refers to this as ‘phase EQ’, and suggests that a sound created in this manner will hold its place much more solidly
in the mix.51 ‘Not only that, it won’t wipe out everything else,’ he adds, ‘because
it will have such a separate and distinct sound character.’
Which Polarity Setting is Correct?
With coincident multimiking, you’ll almost always want to choose the polarity setting that gives the loudest
combined sound. However, with non-coincident arrays, there is no ‘correct’ setting, because there will always
be some phase-cancellation whichever polarity relationship you choose between the mic signals—so you
just have to use your ears! One thing I have noticed, though, is that if I’m having trouble deciding which
polarity setting I prefer for a spaced pair of mics, then it’s an indication that I should adjust the mic positions.
Somehow, good mic positions usually seem to have one polarity relationship that’s clearly more attractivesounding than the other.
236 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
The ‘phase EQ’ is easily my favourite guitar overdubbing technique, because it’s so easy to experiment with new sounds and textures, and great to
do this in collaboration with the guitarist themselves if they’re sitting in the control-room with
you. It’s also excellent when you’re layering up
several distorted guitars, because being able to give
each layer its own unique sound tends to create a
much thicker and more impressive multitracked
texture. However, this powerful method can also
be applied to acoustic instruments, something that
both Eddie Kramer52 and Frank Filipetti53 have
talked about in interview. ‘[You] can create certain
[comb-filtering effects] that work to your advantage,’ remarks Filipetti, for instance, ‘and sometimes work better than doing it with an equaliser.’
With acoustic instruments, though, any mic technique that relies on strong comb-filtering will be
heavily compromised if the sound source moves,
so more-or-less stationary instruments such as
drums, keyboards, and tuned percussion are most
likely to reward the effort. Even then, however,
the inherent artificiality of creative comb-filtering
between the mics may prove a sticking point, simply because most listeners
have a strong impression of how acoustic instruments should sound naturally—whereas a much wider range of timbres is fair game with electric instruments because there’s not really a ‘natural’ sound people can measure against.
7.2.3 Ambience and Room Mics
Spaced mics can also balance an instrument’s close-miked sound with a more
distant perspective. In some cases ‘more distant’ just means filling out a spotlighted sound with a full-instrument picture, for example when Al Schmitt mentions putting an ambience microphone up by the curve of a grand piano’s lid to
enhance his spaced close-mic array.54 This approach is quite common for ‘catching the air’ around an electric guitar too: Jon Kelly55 had Neumann U87s both
close up and four feet away on Kate Bush’s ‘Wuthering Heights’; a similarly distanced AKG C414 was used by Robbie Adams56 to complement a close Shure
SM57 for U2’s guitarist the Edge on ‘Achtung Baby’, while the guitars on Shania
Twain’s ‘Up!’ were recorded with a comparable setup by Bob Bullock;57 and Toby
Scott58 used Neumann’s KM86 small-diaphragm condenser instead of the C414
for the guitars on Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born in the USA’. On kick drum a similar
role is commonly filled by a large-diaphragm condenser, traditionally the classic
Neumann supercardioid U47 FET placed a foot or more away from the drum’s
resonant head, although in my experience cheaper products will usually serve
pretty well too, as long as they can take the level without distorting.

You can get a vast array

simply by combining the

levels and polarities.

plug-in (below).
As with any other non-coincident configuration, the relative polarity/phase/
timing of the mic signals will require careful attention, because the more distant mic will still be picking up some direct sound, so you’ll need to massage
the comb-filtering response to obtain the best tone. Where the aim is to faithfully represent the timbre of an acoustic musician with this kind of multimic
rig, some engineers like to use digital delay to time-align the instrument’s
direct sound in each mic signal, thereby minimising comb-filtering artefacts.
You can do this in the same kind of way we phase-aligned coincident mics in
Section 7.1.1, flipping the delayed signal’s polarity to search for the setting that
yields the greatest cancellation. (You can quickly get into the right ballpark by
remembering that sound travels roughly one foot per millisecond.) However,
the downside of this kind of time-alignment is that the level and timbre of the
direct sound (and therefore also the apparent dry/wet balance) become very
sensitive to small movements of the instrument, so I wouldn’t recommend it
unless you’re dealing with a stationary source such as a stand-mounted drum
or acoustic piano. At least not if you value your sanity at mixdown.
Once you back off (or angle) the more distant mic such that reflected sound
from the instrument begins to dominate over direct sound, comb-filtering
begins to impinge less powerfully on the multimic array’s combined tone,
and the ‘room mic’ becomes more a tool for moderating your recording’s
238 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
dry/wet balance. Despite the ease of adding digital reverberation to dry sounds
at mixdown, room mics like these remain a fixture on many professional sessions. ‘There’s a lot more character to real rooms,’ explains S. Husky Hoskulds,
‘and they don’t have that flag on them that shouts “Reverb!”. Room sound has
dimension to it, because a real room has real dimensions.’59 One of the big
reasons why room reverb often sounds better, in my view, is that a real room
reflects sound from the whole instrument, whereas an artificial reverb can only
work with the limited proportion of the instrument’s sound that’s picked up by
the close mics. (That said, if the room or recording chain are too noisy, then digital reverb may turn out to be a lesser evil.) As long as you try to find a room
that suits the sound you’re looking for, finding a room-miking position is primarily just a case of using your ears, as discussed in Section 6.1.1,
but remember to pay particular attention to the low-end
response of what you’re hearing, because room resonances can make a big difference to the sound, and
the boundary effect may be able to counteract timbral thinning of directional mics used at a distance.
If you decide to try mic placements in excess of
about 30 feet, this may affect your mic choices.
For quieter instruments, noise concerns with
dynamic and ribbon models will eliminate those
from the shortlist in most cases. Even if you are able
to capture a ribbon cleanly enough for distant miking,
‘Although omnis
are a good generalpurpose choice for room mics,
in smaller rooms a cardioid or
figure-eight mic with its null directed
towards the sound source can
actually create an illusion of
increased room size.’
Managing Expectations
If you’re recording your own music, it’s entirely up to you to decide what sound you chase when recording any
instrument in the studio. The moment you’re working on anyone else’s material, though, you’re dealing with other
people’s expectations, which usually means doing a bit of research before the session to find out what kinds of
sounds they prefer. In this respect it’s really useful to get hold of any previous recordings the artist/band may
have done, as well as finding out what kinds of music they listen to. Take the time to thrash out what they do
and don’t like about each of these productions, and which parts of the current project they relate to—it’s no use
taking your inspiration from a specific single’s guitar sound if the band actually like that record for the bass!
Listening to live performances and rehearsals can also be revealing, because they show you how a performer
is used to hearing themselves while playing, which can inform the way you set things up on your recording
session. If you go to a band’s rehearsal room and see the bass player’s rig in a corner (incurring serious
boundary effect) and the guitarist’s combo on the floor firing directly at his knees (putting his ears off-axis to its
high-frequency beam), then you can take those sonic preferences into account when moulding the amp sounds
for those same musicians in a studio environment.
Difficulties can arise, however, where expectations conflict. For example, an acoustic guitarist may complain
that your recording isn’t capturing the full warmth and depth of their instrument, even though that kind of
low midrange might be of no use to the shiny pop arrangement you happen to be overdubbing on. If a little
explanation doesn’t immediately resolve this, then it’s rarely a good idea to argue about it in principle, as I
mentioned in Section 3.4—let the musician have their way in the first instance, and once you’ve got something
to listen to it should become pretty obvious to everyone whether the tone feels right in context.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 239
however, its muted high-frequency response may be an issue
unless you’re deliberately seeking out more rounded timbres.
When sound travels larger distances, the air itself absorbs
some high-frequency energy, and any mic with a duller tonality will exacerbate that effect. (The exact amount of high-frequency damping depends on how humid the air is, but you
may potentially lose as much as 3dB at 10kHz if you’re miking from 30 feet away.) Small-diaphragm condensers are also
noisier in the main than large-diaphragm mics, although the
downside with large diaphragms is that their coloured offaxis tone may cause problems when reflected sound’s arriving
from all angles. I usually opt for the truer small-diaphragm
sound myself, especially when working with cheaper mics,
even though that gives me a little more noise.
Although omnis are a good general-purpose choice for room
mics, in smaller rooms a cardioid or figure-eight mic with
its null directed towards the sound source can actually create an illusion of increased room size. Both Tony Visconti,60
and Stuart Sullivan61 mention directing mics towards a wall
or window in this situation to emphasise the reflections. ‘The
reflection not only gives me a little more delay,’ says Sullivan,
‘it also takes away a little of the edge and smears it so the
image isn’t quite as clear.’
Simon Dawson62 and Ben Hillier63 take advantage of another time-honoured stunt: ‘If I needed more ambience,’ recalls Hillier, ‘I’d just open the
door to the corridor and stick a mic down the end. It makes for a more
colourful sound.’ What’s particularly good about capturing the ambience
separately like this is that you can still keep the close-mic signal very dry and
tight—something that wouldn’t be as easy if the instrument itself had been
put into a more reverberant space. Even in purpose-built recording venues
there’s much to recommend this approach, and you can hear ‘non-studio’
spaces being corralled into service on many famous records: a concrete loading
bay on Brian Adams’s ‘Cuts Like a Knife’ and ‘Reckless’;64 a bathroom at Coast
Recorders for Kim Deal’s singing on the Breeders’ Last Splash;
65 and another
bathroom (pink-tiled this time!) for Madonna’s vocals on ‘Like a Virgin’.66
Steve Albini makes another useful small-studio suggestion: ‘I’ll sometimes
delay the ambient microphones by a few milliseconds, and that has the effect
of getting rid of some of the slight phasing that you hear when you have microphones at a distance and up close … When you move them far enough away,
they start sounding like acoustic reflections, which is what they are.’67 However,
phase-cancellation isn’t the only factor at work here, because increasing the
delay between a close mic and a room mic also has the psychological effect
of moving the instrument closer to the listener. This is because, in natural listening, the direct sound from a close source will reach your ears much more
Figure 7.9
When a musician is right
next to the mic (position
A), the distance their
direct sound has to
travel to reach the mic is
only a small proportion
of the distance that
sonic reflections from
the room must travel.
As the musician moves
away from the mic
(position B), these pathlengths become more
comparable, so the time

and reflected sounds
decreases.
240 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
quickly than the reflected sound, whereas the reflected sound of a more distant
source will follow the direct sound more closely—as illustrated in Figure 7.9.
(You may also hear this perceptual distancing illusion when adjusting timing offsets between the signals of the quite closely spaced mics discussed in
Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, but frankly the effect is normally pretty small by comparison with the massive tonal changes incurred by comb-filtering.)
You do have to be a bit wary, though, when delaying room mics, or indeed
when placing room mics more than about 30 feet away, because this can perceptually separate the onset of the room mic’s signal from that of the closemic’s, creating an audible ‘slapback’ echo effect. While this has a certain retro
appeal in some styles, it can quickly become an annoying distraction for the
listener, especially in more naturalistic acoustic genres.
7.3 Multi-Amping and Reamping Electric
Instruments
7.3.1 Multiple Amplifiers
With amplified instruments, especially electric guitars, there’s another situation
where multimiking becomes almost inevitable: when the instrument is feeding several amplifiers at once. On the simplest level, a multi-amp approach just
increases your tonal options, as Glen Kolotkin remarked while discussing Carlos
Santana’s Supernatural sessions: ‘He was playing through an assortment of amplifiers at the same time, and by using multiple microphones I was able to get just
the right blend.’69 Dave Jerden suggests a more structured plan of attack here,
though: ‘Instead of [having] one sound and one amp [and] using EQ, I’ll use an
amp basically dedicated to lows, one delegated to midrange, and one for high
end. I might use a Vox or Matchless cabinet like an AC30 with a Big Muff—that
will give a big bottom end, especially with a Les Paul. Then for midrange I’ll use
some kind of Marshall, a 50- or 100-Watt lead, or a Bogner. And for high end I’ll
use a Soldano or another Bogner for a more piercing sound.’70 And it’s not just
for guitars—Jerden has triple-amped bass too, as did Tommaso Colliva and Rich
Costey while working on Muse’s album Drones.
71
Combining Signals from Pickups and Mics
Although signals from instrument pickups and stand-alone contact mics are sometimes used on their own for
studio purposes (most commonly for electric bass guitar and electromechanical keyboards), they’re much more
widely recorded in combination with a microphone signal—especially on bass guitar, but also with acoustic
guitar and upright bass. Because such signals are transduced directly from an instrument’s vibrations without
having to travel through the air, they’ll always arrive ahead of any signal from a microphone, whether that mic’s
trained directly on an acoustic instrument or a speaker cabinet. As such, you’ll be exposed to the same phasecancellation issues that crop up between the signals in a non-coincident multimic array. So if you don’t initially
get the combined sound you’re looking for, try moving the microphone a fraction, flipping its signal polarity,
or applying some kind of variable-phase or delay processing before reaching for the EQ. ‘With bass [there’s]
usually a DI and a [mic] on the amp,’ says Andy Johns, for instance, ‘and then what I do is run it through a delay
line so I can pull it back about 3 or 4 milliseconds so it’s in phase with the amp.’68
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 241
Mike Hedges,72 Ryan Ulyate,73 and Eric Valentine74 on the other hand, use
multiple amps to adapt the guitar texture to different sections of the arrangement without having to use layered parts. Hedges, for instance, uses amps with
different amounts of drive, so that at mixdown he can fade up the more heavily driven signals for song sections when thicker guitar textures are required,
obviating the need for additional overdubs.
Multi-amping can also buy you mixdown flexibility when the guitarist insists
on feeding delay/reverb effects directly to the amp. Here’s Ken Nelson talking about putting this tactic into action with Coldplay’s Jonny Buckland:
‘Jonny has a Fender Twin Reverb, and he has all these delays going into it,
and … I just wanted the option of a bit more dryness. They had another
Twin Reverb, a slightly different version, and I said, “What would be great
would be if you could use both amps, one having all your delays going into
it, and one that’s completely dry.” So every time we’d record both amps.’75
Jez Coad used a similar technique when recording Simple Minds, where
three amps were used for Charlie Burchill’s guitar parts, the central one dry
and the others panned to the sides of the stereo picture layering in effects:
‘You got the best of both worlds,’ says Coad.76 ‘You got all the power in the
middle, and then you got all the lovely, diffused, echoey chorus and any
other kind of modulation coming out of the side ones, so we could balance
the amount of power to the amount of psychedelia going on!’
7.3.2 Reamping Electric Guitars
A more common means of insuring against Death
by Guitar Pedals is to record a clean DI feed from
the guitar (usually alongside the miked amplifier signal), so you can reamp it if a cleaner
or drier sound is required at a later date. But
there’s another big reason why reamping is
becoming increasingly popular. ‘It’s just such a
lifesaver,’ says Dan Austin.77 ‘It means you can
keep a really great performance and worry about
the sound later.’ If driven by a desire to avoid boring the talent senseless while you’re tending to technicalities (or by the need to record a performer’s amp while
the neighbours are out!), then I can see the appeal of this method, but it
should also be said that a great sound can help inspire a great performance,
so I wouldn’t advise routinely chickening out of finding guitar sounds during tracking. Also, bear in mind that some players are suspicious of engineers
wanting to record DI signals, because they worry you’re going to airbrush their
unique tonal personality into something unrepresentative at mixdown. Some
instrumentalists may also have strong views about the presence of a DI box’s
circuitry in their signal path unacceptably altering the tone and/or feel of the
instrument, and if they do, I wouldn’t ever try to force the issue—in the grand
scheme of things, a happy player will always sound better!

Some Tips for Overdubbing on Location
There are a lot of instruments that you may be unable to record within your studio space—the neighbours may
complain if drums or electric guitars start thrashing away, while getting things like timpani, grand pianos, and
church organs up the stairs may be a challenge! And, of course, a lot of budget studios have distinctly dodgy
acoustics too. So pretty much anyone doing serious recording on a budget will sometimes have to contemplate
the idea of recording on location. Fortunately, this is easier nowadays than it’s ever been, because projectstudio equipment is so portable—you can realistically carry an entire overdubbing rig on the train, even if you’re
multimiking. And Mark Howard argues that working in different locations is beneficial both commercially and
creatively: ‘For each project I work on, I do an installation with my own gear .… I set up, I do the record, and
I tear the installation down.82 It’s a great way to make records, because there are no budgets anymore these
days, and like this I don’t have any overheads. You also don’t fall into the same routines with always the same
drum setup in the same place .… It allows for a lot of creative accidents to happen, and as a result I’m always
discovering new sounds.’ Sai Shravanam suggests that another advantage of taking mics out and about is that
The mechanics of reamping are pretty straightforward,
but you won’t get the best sound just by plugging a linelevel output into a guitar amplifier with a balanced-tounbalanced adapter lead. An instrument amplifier’s
input is designed to receive an instrument-level signal from instrument-impedance circuitry, so you need
something to bring the level down by 30–40dB and
deal with the impedance-matching. There are dedicated
reamping boxes that will do this for less than $150
(£120), but you can sometimes get away with just turning down the output level in your recording system and
then using a passive DI box in reverse, as we did when
extending a guitar instrument cable in Section 6.4.
7.3.3 Other Applications of Reamping
Electric guitars are by no means the only instruments
you might consider reamping. ‘When I was recording with Michael [Jackson] and Quincy [Jones],’
remarks Bruce Swedien, ‘what I did was pick a really
good room and record the synths through amps and
speakers … The direct sound output of a synthesizer is very uninteresting, but
this can make the sonic image fascinating.’78 Gareth Jones followed a similar
approach when creating the dense ambiences of Depeche Mode’s ‘Some Great
Reward’.79 Some producers reamp acoustic guitar too, although with more of
an emphasis on adding distortion than room ambience. ‘I actually prefer the
amplified acoustic sound in some situations,’ says Daniel Lanois, ‘because it
can give you a little more personality, a little more harmonic distortion.’80 To
hear a specific record that uses this, check out Eric Rosse’s production of Sara
Bareille’s ‘Love Song’, where he felt the reamping ‘gave the acoustic guitars a
little bit more edge.’81
Figure 7.10
An affordable reamping device (such as the Radial Pro
RMP shown here) has many applications for smallstudio work.
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 243
many instruments only sound their best in certain acoustic environments: ‘There is an incredible instrument
called the nadaswaram in the South of India. It’s a long pipe that they play in the temples. I used to bring
them into the studio, and when I recorded them, they used to sound like little whistles … The day I took all my
equipment and recorded this instrument in the temple … I realised: oh, this is nothing to do with the technology.
I’m missing the stone walls of the temple. I’m missing multiple reflections that bring different sounds at different
points in time. The reverberations add beautiful midrange that this instrument actually does not have.’83
Planning sessions for evenings and weekends can often get you out-of-hours access to office conference rooms,
school gymnasiums, and churches for free if you ask nicely, and background noise levels may well be lower at
those times too. To get the best results for overdubs on a budget, I’d suggest investing in the best pair of openbacked studio headphones you can afford, because these will give better monitoring fidelity than closed-back
designs—and you can only record as well as you can hear! Although open-backed cans won’t isolate you from
the instrument’s sound in a one-room recording setup, it’s usually possible to listen from outside the door on
the end of a headphone extension cable if you want to make critical sound judgements while the musician’s
performing. (If not, have another look at the one-room workarounds in Section 3.2.4.)
Here are a few more specific tips if you’re considering taking the plunge.
■ Try to check out the recording venue beforehand, so you can estimate your gear requirements. Note the positions
of power sockets, and pace out the distance between your proposed recorder and instrument locations to work
out what cables you’ll need. Switch lights on to check for buzzes, and have a careful listen for background noise
from things like heaters,
plumbing, air-conditioning
units, and traffic. If you have
to coordinate your session
with a building’s security
staff, confirm opening/
closing times and make sure
you know where to get/return
any necessary keys. Few
things can hinder a session
more than surly janitors, but
if you appear trustworthy and
treat them as the important
folks they are, you’d be
surprised how often they’ll go
out of their way to help you.
■ A simple mains-tester plug
is a must for checking that
the venue’s power supply
is correctly wired, as is
a residual current device
(RCD) or ground fault
circuit interrupter (GFCI) so
that no-one gets fried in
the event of an electrical
mishap.
■ After your reconnaissance
mission, draw yourself a
quick diagram of the setup
Figure 7.11
When recording on location, a cheap mains tester plug like this one comes in very
handy—here it’s showing that the socket’s live and neutral pins have been connected in
reverse.
244 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
you’re going to use, because this makes it
much easier to work out all the cables and
stands you’re going to need. I find it’s helpful
to give separate consideration to power wiring,
input-chain wiring, monitoring/foldback/
talkback wiring, and digital/data wiring—you’re
more likely to miss something out if you try to
tackle them all at once.
■ If it’s a bit of a trek to the venue, try to build
some redundancy into your setup, so that
if something flakes out it doesn’t ruin the
session. In particular, make sure you’ve got
at least one extra cable of every type you’re
using, a spare pair of headphones, and an
extra mic or two if possible.
■ Write yourself a full kit list before you go. The
first time you do this, it’ll feel like a chore, but
trust me: it’ll be worth its weight in gold. Not
only will it stop you leaving anything behind
after the session, but it’ll also make planning
similar jaunts much easier in future.
■ A roll of gaffer tape should always be on the
essentials list but watch that you don’t stick gaffer on anything it can’t cleanly be removed from—at least if
you ever fancy recording in that venue again!
■ I always take a small pair of locking pliers and a multi-tool with me on location, because I seem to need at
least one of them on every job. A torch regularly comes in handy too, although most mobile phones now
have a torch function that’ll usually do fine.
■ All battery-powered equipment should be given fresh batteries, and you should also carry spares.
■ Old towels/blankets/quilts are tremendously helpful, whether for impromptu acoustic dampening, covering
over cable runs, or just holding doors open. Although you can rig up quilts with gaffer, I prefer to fix cheap
carabiners to them and then use bungee cords to hang them up, because gaffer always seems to lose its
grip just when you’re in the middle of a take! (If you really want to kill your singer, then I imagine there are
more entertaining methods than smothering them.) A mic stand set up at full height with the boom arm
horizontal makes a ‘T’ shape that’s good for hanging blankets over.
7.4 The Joy of Commitment
While multimiking and reamping offer many operational and sonic benefits,
they do also encourage you to defer important sonic decisions until mixdown
by recording all the mic/DI signals to separate tracks. I always urge small-studio
producers to avoid doing this if they can possibly help it, though. First of all,
handling all the separate tracks almost always slows down your workflow: a ballooning track-count makes it more difficult to navigate around the project, more
difficult to edit between takes, more difficult to set up monitor/foldback mixes,
and more time-consuming to back things up. Plus, a computer’s CPU and/or
hard drive are more likely to run out of bandwidth with huge numbers of tracks,
increasing the likelihood of system instability.
Figure 7.12
It’s a lot easier to hang up blankets/quilts for recording purposes if
you fix little carabiners at strategic points around the edge..
Multimiking in Mono Chapter 7 245
If you get into the habit of recording multimiked sounds to a single track (and
of recording any reamped audio at the earliest opportunity), it forces you to
shoulder the responsibility of capturing timbres that actually suit the production while you’re working. Too many people in project studios use ‘leaving my
options open’ as an excuse for not deciding what each multimiked instrument
should sound like. They put up mics rather aimlessly, without any real sense
of the tone they’re searching for, and end up with several different shades of ‘inappropriate’ and/or ‘rubbish’ preserved for posterity. And the moment you leave
an instrument in your monitor mix with a
sound that isn’t properly serving the production, it means you’re having to assess
any subsequent overdubs within a questionable context, so you’ll be more
likely to misjudge those timbres too.
So do everyone a favour: commit, commit, and then commit some more!
‘Making records is about making decisions,’
comments John Leckie.84 ‘If you delay those
decisions, you pay the price of having to sort
them out later. And they mount up, so the sooner
you make them the better.’ ‘Delaying decisions until the
end of the process is absurd,’ adds Glyn Johns, ‘the biggest time and money
waster altogether, in my view, that can possibly be!’85 Sure, you’ll muck up a decision from time to time, but the worst-case scenario is that you have to rerecord
something once in a while—big hairy deal! The worst-case scenario for ditherers,
on the other hand, is that every project takes ages and culminates in a mix engineer’s sweat-drenched nightmare, which is a much bleaker prospect. ‘Decisions
are your friends,’ says David Bottrill, ‘and what that means is that when you commit to things and you don’t try to keep too many options open, you build on top
of that. Sometimes maybe a wrong decision ends up being a happy accident for
a later right decision.’86 Brian Eno agrees: ‘If something goes wrong, I try to think
“Where can that take us?” not “Oh no, we’ve wasted a day!” We’ve only wasted
a day if we don’t make use of what’s happened as a result … It was just a funny
way of getting to a different place.’87 Jacquire King is similarly sanguine about the
risk of creative misfires: ‘I’d rather commit to an idea and a path forward on a
song and get pretty close and then realise that I’ve missed it and then recut it …
I want what I record today on a song to sort of force my hand on what I’m going
to do on it tomorrow … If I don’t put myself in the position of having to make
decisions in the moment, I don’t get the result in the end. The best creative mode
is to be in the moment, make decisions, commit, get it, and move on.’88 For his
part, Matt Wallace regrets not having realised these truths sooner: ‘My philosophy [now] is that I want to be open to falling flat on my face and looking like an
asshole and ruining things, because if you’re open to doing that, you’re open to
doing something great. I spent a decade making records within the confines of
the “safe zone” … and I realised I just sucked for about ten years!’89
‘Too many people in
project studios use “leaving
my options open” as an excuse
for not deciding what each multimiked
instrument should sound like. They put
up mics rather aimlessly, without any real
sense of the tone they’re searching for,
and end up with several different
shades of “inappropriate” and/or
“rubbish” preserved for
posterity.’
246 Part 3 One Source, Multiple Mics
Cut to the Chase ■ Coincident multimic arrays allow you to blend different mic signals together in an intuitive way. You can mount microphones on a single stand with appropriate hardware and
phase-align them by ear using polarity inversion. Crossed pairs of coincident mics effectively provide customised polar patterns, and can also control the levels of different facets
of an instrument’s sound or alter the recording’s dry/wet ratio. Combining different mic
designs increases your timbral options, especially if the tonalities are contrasted.
■ Non-coincident miking offers even greater tonal potential than coincident multimiking
but is less intuitive to control because of comb-filtering between the mics. As such, perchannel polarity inversion facilities are vital, and variable phase/delay-adjustment tools
can also be useful for more nuanced sonic adjustments, but bear in mind that time-offsetting mics can also affect an instrument’s perceived distance.
■ Multi-amping electric instruments can increase the range of available tones, as well as
offering a way of controlling guitar effects balances at mixdown. If you record an electric
instrument’s DI signal, you can later reamp it to completely change the amplified sound.
Reamping also has applications for synths and acoustic instruments.
■ Recording on location offers many practical and sonic advantages for project-studio
engineers.
■ Don’t use multimiking and reamping techniques as an excuse for indecisiveness. To work
most efficiently and effectively, commit to sound decisions as early as you can.
■ Overdub at least one of the following instruments with a crossed pair of mics:
acoustic piano, acoustic guitar/mandolin/banjo/harp, tuned percussion.
■ Overdub any electric guitar or electromechanical keyboard through an amplifier
using a coincident array of tonally contrasted microphones—preferably a condenser, a ribbon, and a dynamic. Take a DI feed from the instrument as well, so
that you can experiment with mixing that in too.
■ In both cases, prepare and phase-align the microphone array in advance of the
session. Double-check the phase-alignment with the instrumentalist at the start
of the session. Record all microphone and DI signals to separate tracks, but make
sure you aim for an appropriate mix of them on the session, just as much as you’d
concentrate on getting a good sound if you were restricted to using a single mic.
Assignment 1: Coincident Multimiking and Reamping
If you really can’t muster the confidence to jettison individual multimic signals, at least bounce them down to a single track and archive the constituent components somewhere out of sight before trying to overdub any new
parts alongside, so that you keep pushing yourself to form an opinion about
how the final mix should sound. That said, if the purpose of your multimiking or reamping approach is to give you dry/wet control over an instrument’s
recorded room reverb or delay/reverb effects, then playing safe becomes a lot
more defensible, because it’s not a bad idea to leave those judgements until
the mixdown stage. ‘It’s easy to make something more live-sounding or roomysounding after the fact,’ says John Porter, ‘but it’s impossible to make something less roomy-sounding after the fact … once it’s in that position in the
room, you can’t bring it any closer.’90

Assignment 2: Non-Coincident Multimiking
■ Overdub at least one of the following instruments using non-coincident multimiking
techniques: acoustic piano, acoustic guitar/mandolin/banjo/harp, upright bass. In
addition to a combination of close mics, also record at least one room mic.
■ Overdub one of each of the following groups of instruments using a non-coincident
array of tonally contrasted microphones, including at least one room mic: amplified
electric guitar or electromechanical keyboard; any orchestral string, wind, or brass
instrument. Take a DI signal in addition to the microphones wherever possible.
■ Keep all mic and DI signals on separate tracks but aim for an appropriate mix of
them on the session, as in Assignment 1.
■ Following the session, return to the recordings in order to re-evaluate and experiment with the microphone and DI signals. In addition to using polarity reversal
facilities, try to get hold of a variable phase/delay-adjustment device to explore
the finer tonal shades this makes available.
Web Resources
On this book’s companion website you’ll find a selection of resources to support this
chapter, including:
■ a demonstration of the phase-alignment technique described in this chapter, and
audio files showcasing the tonal scope offered by a wide selection of multimiking
techniques on different instruments.
■ links to affordable multimic mounting hardware and phase-manipulation software.
■ further reading about multimiking electric guitars, and about using speakers and
headphones as microphones.

■ Following the session, return to the recordings in order to re-evaluate and experiment with the microphone and DI signals. In particular, try reamping both mic and
DI signals to get a feel for how this adds to your sound palette, and so that you can
further experiment with multimiking techniques without pressure from the musician.</p>
